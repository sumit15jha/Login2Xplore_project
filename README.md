**Title of The Project**: Product Database

**Description:**
This project I have created a database in which user will enter details of product which is to be displayed on any shopping website. Then, those details will be stored into the database.

**Benefits of using JsonPowerDB:**
1. Simplest way to retrieve data in a JSON format.
2. Schema-free, Simple to use, Nimble and In-Memory database.
3. It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX.
4. It is low level (raw) form of data and is also human readable.
5 .It helps developers in faster coding, in-turn reduces development cost.
